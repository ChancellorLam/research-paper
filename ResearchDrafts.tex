	% Claim 1
	\begin{clm}
		The metric dimension of the Franklin Graph is 4.
	\end{clm}
	\begin{proof}
		We will prove this by proving the following statements:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The metric dimension of the Franklin graph is less than or equal to 4.
			\item The metric dimension of the Franklin graph cannot be 3.
		\end{enumerate}
		We begin by proving that the metric dimension of the Franklin graph is less than or equal to 4. We will proceed by giving the chaser a strategy to win in one turn with 4 probes. The chaser should probe points $A,B,I,J$.

		This will result in unique distances for all vertices. Since every vertex has a unique distance, it must be the case that the runner is located. Since it is the case that the chaser is able to locate the runner in 1 turn with 4 probes, it logically follows that the metric dimension of the Franklin graph is less than or equal to 4.
		
		We will now prove that the metric dimension of the Franklin graph cannot be 3. \\
		\textbf{*insert Reilly's Balanced Bipartite? theorem here to prove that the metric dimension of the Franklin graph cannot be 3 here* }
		
		Since the metric dimension of the Franklin graph is less than or equal to 4 and the metric dimension of the Franklin graph cannot be 3, it must be the case where the metric dimension is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4.
		
		Therefore, the metric dimension of the Franklin graph is 4.
	\end{proof}
	
	% Claim 2
	\begin{clm}
		The Franklin Graph is locatable in 3 turns with 2 probes.
	\end{clm}
	\begin{proof}
		We begin by giving the chaser a strategy to win in 3 turns with 2 probes. The chaser should begin by probing the vertices $E$ and $H$.

		This provides the chaser with 6 different distances, $(0,3),(3,0),(1,2),(2,1),(2,3)$ and $(3,2)$. Consider the fact that $(0,3)$ and $(3,0)$ are unique distances. It follows then that if the runner is on vertices $E$ or $H$, it must be the case that the runner will be caught. This leaves the chaser with 4 different non-unique distances of $(1,2),(2,1),(2,3),$ and $(3,2)$. We will now proceed by cases.
		
		\textbf{Case 1:} Consider the case where the chaser has been returned a distance of $(1,2)$ from the first probes on vertices $E$ and $H$. Then the runner must be at one of the vertices $A,F$, or $K$. Recall that the runner cannot move on to $E$ or $H$ because of the no backtracking condition. It follows then that the runner has the ability to move to any of the neighboring vertices $B,C,G,I,L$. Thus, the runner could potentially be located at any of the vertices $A,B,C,F,G,I,K,L$.
		
		The chaser should now probe vertices $F$ and $K$.

		The metric dimension of the Watkins snark is 3.
	\end{clm}
	\begin{proof}
		We begin by giving the chaser an optimal strategy to win in one turn with three probes. The chaser should probe vertices $A$, $U$, $NN$.
		
		This will result in unique distances for all vertices. Since every vertex has a unique distance, it must be the case that the runner is located. Since it is the case that the chaser is able to locate the runner in 1 turn with 3 probes, it logically follows that the metric dimension of the Watkins snark is less than or equal to 3.
		Thus, the metric dimension must be at most 3.
		
		We will now prove that the metric dimension cannot be 2. Reference Reilly's Cubic Theorem thingy.
		
		Since the metric dimension of the Watkins snark is less than or equal to 3 and the metric dimension of the Franklin graph cannot be 2, it must be the case where the metric dimension is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3.
		
		Therefore, the metric dimension of the Watkins snark is 3.
	\end{proof}
	\begin{clm}
		The Watkins snark is locatable in 2 turns with 2 probes.
	\end{clm}
	\begin{proof}
		We begin by giving the chaser a strategy to win in 2 turns with 2 probes. The chaser should begin by probing the vertices $A$ and $FF$.
		
		This provides the chaser with 31 unique distances and 8 non-unique distances. The non-unique distances are $(2,4),(3,6),(4,4),(4,5),(5,4),(6,2),(6,5),$ and $(7,6)$. The runner is a vertex with a unique distance, then it must be the case that the runner will be caught. Thus, the runner can only be on a vertex with a non-unique distance. We will now proceed by cases.
		
		\textbf{Case 1:} Consider the case where the chaser has been returned a distance of $(2,4)$ from the first probes on vertices $A$ and $FF$. Then the runner must be at one of the vertices $C$ or $G$. Recall that the runner cannot move on to $A$ or $FF$ because of the no backtracking condition. It follows then that the runner has the ability to move to any of the neighboring vertices $B,E,F,H,WW$. Thus, the runner could potentially be located at any of the vertices $B,C,E,F,G,H,WW$.
		
		The chaser should now probe vertices $A$ and $GG$.
		
		This provides the chaser 7 different distances, . Consider the fact that these are all unique distances. It follows then that the runner must be caught.
		
		\textbf{Case 2:} Consider the case where the chaser has been returned a distance of $(3,6)$ from the first probes on vertices $A$ and $FF$. Then the runner must be at one of the vertices $O$, $Q$ or $P$. Recall that the runner cannot move on to $A$ or $FF$ because of the no backtracking condition. It follows then that the runner has the ability to move to any of the neighboring vertices $M,R,L,N,S$. Thus, the runner could potentially be located at any of the vertices $M,O,R,L,Q,N,P,S$.
		
		The chaser should now probe vertices $K$ and $QQ$.
		
		This provides the chaser 7 different distances, . Consider the fact that these are all unique distances. It follows then that the runner must be caught.
		
		\textbf{Case 3:} Consider the case where the chaser has been returned a distance of $(4,4)$ from the first probes on vertices $A$ and $FF$. Then the runner must be at one of the vertices $TT$ or $SS$. Recall that the runner cannot move on to $A$ or $FF$ because of the no backtracking condition. It follows then that the runner has the ability to move to any of the neighboring vertices $WW,VV,UU,RR,QQ$. Thus, the runner could potentially be located at any of the vertices $WW,VV,UU,TT,SS,RR,QQ$.
		
		The chaser should now probe vertices $C$ and $OO$.
		
		This provides the chaser 7 different distances, . Consider the fact that these are all unique distances. It follows then that the runner must be caught.
		
		\textbf{Case 4:} Consider the case where the chaser has been returned a distance of $(4,5)$ from the first probes on vertices $A$ and $FF$. Then the runner must be at one of the vertices $L$, $N$, or $PP$. Recall that the runner cannot move on to $A$ or $FF$ because of the no backtracking condition. It follows then that the runner has the ability to move to any of the neighboring vertices $M,O,K,P,Q,UU,QQ,OO$. Thus, the runner could potentially be located at any of the vertices $M,O,K,L,N,P,Q,UU,QQ,PP,OO$.
		
		The chaser should now probe vertices $A$ and $M$.
		
		This provides the chaser 11 different distances, . Consider the fact that these are all unique distances. It follows then that the runner must be caught.
		
		\textbf{Case 5:} Consider the case where the chaser has been returned a distance of $(5,4)$ from the first probes on vertices $A$ and $FF$. Then the runner must be at one of the vertices $K$, $U$, or $UU$. Recall that the runner cannot move on to $A$ or $FF$ because of the no backtracking condition. It follows then that the runner has the ability to move to any of the neighboring vertices $J,X,L,V,N,NN,VV,TT,PP$. Thus, the runner could potentially be located at any of the vertices $J,U,X,L,V,N,K,NN,VV,UU,TT,PP$.
		
		The chaser should now probe vertices $NN$ and $PP$.
		
		This provides the chaser 12 different distances, . Consider the fact that these are all unique distances. It follows then that the runner must be caught.
		
		\textbf{Case 6:} Consider the case where the chaser has been returned a distance of $(6,2)$ from the first probes on vertices $A$ and $FF$. Then the runner must be at one of the vertices $LL$ or $HH$. Recall that the runner cannot move on to $A$ or $FF$ because of the no backtracking condition. It follows then that the runner has the ability to move to any of the neighboring vertices $NN,KK,JJ,II,EE$. Thus, the runner could potentially be located at any of the vertices $NN,LL,KK,JJ,II,HH,EE$.
		
		The chaser should now probe vertices $W$ and $EE$.
		
		This provides the chaser 7 different distances, . Consider the fact that these are all unique distances. It follows then that the runner must be caught.
		
		\textbf{Case 7:} Consider the case where the chaser has been returned a distance of $(6,5)$ from the first probes on vertices $A$ and $FF$. Then the runner must be at one of the vertices $X$ or $V$. Recall that the runner cannot move on to $A$ or $FF$ because of the no backtracking condition. It follows then that the runner has the ability to move to any of the neighboring vertices $U,Z,AA,Y,W$. Thus, the runner could potentially be located at any of the vertices $U,Z,X,AA,V,Y,W$.
		
		The chaser should now probe vertices $M$ and $U$.
		
		This provides the chaser 7 different distances, . Consider the fact that these are all unique distances. It follows then that the runner must be caught.
		
		\textbf{Case 8:} Consider the case where the chaser has been returned a distance of $(7,6)$ from the first probes on vertices $A$ and $FF$. Then the runner must be at one of the vertices $AA$ or $BB$. Recall that the runner cannot move on to $A$ or $FF$ because of the no backtracking condition. It follows then that the runner has the ability to move to any of the neighboring vertices $Z,V,DD,Y$. Thus, the runner could potentially be located at any of the vertices $Z,AA,V,DD,BB,Y$.
		
		The chaser should now probe vertices $M$ and $U$.
		
		This provides the chaser 6 different distances, . Consider the fact that these are all unique distances. It follows then that the runner must be caught.
		
		Therefore, the Watkins snark is locatable in 2 turns with 2 probes.
